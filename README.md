## Assignment 1

I am taking this class for two main reasons. One reason is that this class will complete my Web Development Certificate. The other reason is that I am really trying to improve my coding skills and want to keep learning new things that will help me improve for the future. I intend to use server-side scripting in my world because I would like to be a full stack developer and implement it into the sites. 

## Assignment 2

In this session, I learned about routes and templates. There were many new concepts about server-side scripting that I learned in this assignment. For example, I used node.os for the first time. The node:os module provides operating-system-related utility methods and properties. This helped me a lot to get all the required material needed in my lesson2.js file. I also got a lot of help from the site https://nodejs.org/api/os.html (commented as a resource). I would for sure not be able to get it done without it. I would apply this learning in my world for whenever node.os would seem efficient in a personal/work project. 

## Assignment 3

In this session, I am learning about HTTP GET and HTTP POST request processing. I have learned a little about GET requests in a previous class, but not enough to where I would be comfortable with the topic. For this assignment, I am trying to create a unit converter that converts yards, feet, and inches all together. This is good practice for me though because I can see myself having to use requests like these on different forms for many future projects. So, I would apply this learning in my world for my future projects that will most likely be consisting of some type of form. 

## Assignment 4

In this session, we were introduced to condition and loop structures. I am a little familiar with loops from previous assignements, but never fully understood them. For this assignment, I decided to go with the first activity which was creatinng a math expression game. After doing a little bit of it, I can see how it can be very challenging as there is a lot to account for. One aspect I am looking forward to is the hidden elements I will have to use for this activity to keep track of the game progress. That is something I haven't done yet, but I am interested in the process of it. I believe all of this learning will help me in the future whether I have to do something like this or not. 

## Assignment 5

In this session, I started to learn about strings and files. I get familiar with CSV files and using them in my code. CSV files are text files that contains values separated by commas, and it simulates a table where each row is a new line. So far, I have been more comfortable with this assignment than the last one. I feel like it is coming easier to me than before, but that also could be from having more experience now. I am stil tring to figure this assingment out more, but I am pretty confident with where I am at. 

## Assignment 6

In this session, I started to learn more about arrays. Arrays are data structures that contain a list of values. I have had some experience with arrays from previous classes, but using it the way we are for this assignment is a new skill. I think because this is similar to the last assignment, I should start to understand this one a lot faster than normal since I was pretty comfortable with the other one. I am looking forward to what all the future assignments are going to look like, and am excited to learn new skills. I hope to use what I learn here in the future in whatever I end up doing that is related to web development.

## Assignment 7

In this session, I got to learn about associative arrays, or better know as objects in JavaScript. This wasn't completely new to me, so this assignment went by super quick. All I had to do was take last week's assignment and change the two-dimensional array into an object. From there, I just made sure everything was defined with the new object, and it all worked fine. I can see how this can be useful for future projects, so I will keep these in mind.
