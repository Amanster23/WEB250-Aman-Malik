# WEB250-Aman-Malik

I am taking this class for two main reasons. One reason is that this class will complete my Web Development Certificate. The other reason is that I am really trying to improve my coding skills and want to keep learning new things that will help me improve for the future. I intend to use server-side scripting in my world because I would like to be a full stack developer and implement it into the sites.
